# Technologies used:
* [x] HTML, CSS, JS

## For this project I've used:
- Responsive design
- Flexbox
- Accessibility in mind
- BEM Naming
- Aesthetic minimalism
- Google Maps iframe

### Main goals:
-  Create a design file
-  Code a coming soon page for a Sacramento restaurant serving drinks and food that caters to professionals ages 21-80 that is opening in two weeks.

## Conclusion:
- I chose CSS Flexbox over Bootstrap because I did not need to add an additional framework which allows the page views to be faster.
- I loved considering the project from all angles which is what I did when I tested it in Chrome, Safari and mobile devices.

## Usage:

1. Open the `index.html` file in any browser
